    What type pf food should be given?
</h1>
<p>Masala-filled, oily food can often be harmful to animals. This is why you need to be careful before feeding them leftovers. Stick to simple boiled foods like rice, potatoes and eggs. A mix of soft-boiled rice mixed with small portions of boiled potatoes and a little bit of ghee is a simple meal perfect for stray dogs.</p>
